## Description

  This application is a simulation tap-room management system that allows a user to add kegs of specified beer to the tap-room, designate the beer's name, brewery, alcohol content, and number of pints in the keg, and click a button to indicate when a pint has been sold, decrementing the number of pints in the keg. The user may also edit any of the keg details at will. All kegs are displayed in a keg list, and any kegs in the list may be clicked to display details and allow the user to edit, sell a pint, or delete the selected keg. This program was built using the React JavaScript library in Visual Studio Code.
